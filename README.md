# SkyBlock üèù
Build your island, level up and have fun! That's skyblock, a former gamemode of the [MyCliff - Minecraft Server](http://www.mycliff.net)

## About the project

This is a legacy project that contains the source code of the skyblock gamemode that was playable on a minecraft server projetct I used to work on (back in 2014 - 2015). It was built upon a generator-library for the bukkit server client. This project is not maintained anymore and just serves as a reference / my own nostalgia ü•∏.

## About the gamemode

This project provided the functions to play the SkyBlock gamemode. In this gamemode, you started on a flying island just given a few basic tools. Throughout the game you were able to expand, build and design your own island and complete challenges. Since this is a multiplayer-mode you also were able to connect with other players, team up on your island or do trading. The included level and progression system in this project helped players to keep track of their success.

MyCliff was a german server and community project I started and maintained together with some friends from 2012 - 2018.
